#### Introduction ####

[Siddhi](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi/) is a Streaming and Complex Event Processing engine that listens to events from data streams, detects complex conditions described via a Streaming SQL language, and triggers actions.

Siddhi maintains two distributions as Siddhi-Runner distribution and Siddhi-Tooling distribution.
* Siddhi-Runner distribution bundles the Siddhi runtime which runs the Siddhi logic in a production environment.
* Siddhi-Tooling distribution bundles the tooling editor profile which can be used for developing, testing and debugging Siddhi applications before moving to production.
