@APP:description("Demonstrates how to calculate the average of events by using a Siddhi lengthbatch window.")

/*
Purpose:
    This application demonstrates how to simulate random events via Feed Simulation and calculate the average of events. The aggregation is executed on events within a length batch window. 

Prerequisites:
    1) Save this sample

Executing the Sample:
    1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'
    2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages would be shown on the console
        * LengthBatchWindowAvg.siddhi - Started Successfully!

Testing the Sample:
    Configure random event simulation as follows
    1) Click on 'Event Simulator' (double arrows on left tab)
    2) Click 'Feed Simulation' -> 'Create'
    3) Give a name (Or the default name in the place holder will be used as its name)
    4) Select 'Random' as the 'Simulation Source'
    5) Click on 'Add Simulation Source'
    6) Select LengthBatchWindowAvg as 'Siddhi App Name'
    7) Select TradesStream as 'StreamName'
    8) Keep 'Primitive Based' as the config type for itemId,price and volume
    9) Save the simulator configuration
    10) The newly created simulator would be listed under 'Active Feed Simulations' of 'Feed Simulation' tab
    11) Click on the start button (Arrow symbol) next to the newly created simulator

Viewing the Results:
         See the output on the console. The output show average of events on the 10 events that has been collected in a batch manner.
